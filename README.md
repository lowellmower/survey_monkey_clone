# survey-monkey-with-React
Survey Monkey clone with ReactJS for dynamic form building

## This was a project to create a SurveyMonkey clone with the following objectives: 
  - Be able to create a survey with dynamic input fields
  - Be able to create a submission to a particular survey
  - Be able to display information on the number of submissions and data related to a particular survey

## The following libraries / technologies were used to achieve this: 
  - **ReactJS** for dynamic forms with one-way data binding
  - **d3.js** for generating charts based on survey data
  - **Ruby on Rails** as a backend for orchestrating routes and generating __JSON__ data
